This is a design project about creating a multistage amplifier that has the following: 

3 BJT Transistors

No-load voltage gain of about 50 (± 10%) 

Maximum no-load output voltage swing: greator than 8 V peak to peak at 1kHz

Loaded voltage gain that is larger than 90% of the no-load voltage gain at 1 kHz and where load resistance is 1 kΩ);

Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 kHz and RL = 1 kΩ): no smaller than 4 V peak to peak; 

Input Resistance greator than 20 kΩ;

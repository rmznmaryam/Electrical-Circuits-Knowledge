This is a design project about creating a multistage amplifier that has the following: 
BJT Transistors
3 transistors
No-load voltage gain of about 50 (± 10%) 
Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 kHz): no smaller than 8 V peak to peak;  
Loaded voltage gain (at 1 kHz and with RL = 1 kΩ): no smaller than 90% of the no-load voltage gain; 
Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 kHz and RL = 1 kΩ): no smaller than 4 V peak to peak; 
Rinput greator than 20 kΩ;
